# Pokedex Project

It is a pokemon card deck where the player can choose his card according to the pokemon's abilities.

The users should be able to:

- Choose the pokemon card and visualize the chosen one.

## Technologies:

- HTML;
- CSS;
- Javascript.

## What I learned: 

Make the selected card appear and the others remain hidden, using the arrow function.
